This project was intended to introduce us to working with object-oriented programming constructs in Python 
including classes and objects by building classes to represent creatures and a cataloguing system.

It was a parody on a pokemon pokedex that was used to store information about creatures in a catalogue.
To implement the project a "Pakuri" class was created to layout the attributes of each creature and create
methods to access and update information about them. A second file called "Pakudex" was created to run a 
text based interface that could store and retrieve information about Pakuri that a user enters in.
